 # Continental

 This is an Ionic (v4) project to create an Ionic Continental version of a previous project!

## Introduction

[Continental](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_Rummy) is a card game who requires the players to keep notes on their points throughout the whole game.
This app is made in order to ease that part for the players, as well as reminding them of the different rounds they have to play!

## Features

* Multi-language support: Currently Spanish and English are available.
* Multi-language Audio support: Spanish and English. It is also possible to disable it in the Options menu.
* The current session is always saved on the phone. Restarting the app won't cause you to lose count of the points.

## Requirements

* Android 5+
